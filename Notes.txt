Create React App:
    - npx create-react-app app_name
    - The package.json file contains your dependencies. When you npm install, this updates automatically. 

Create Server with Node:
    - create a seperate directory for your react and server e.g. mkdir server
    - inside this you will npm install node, which will create a package.json file.
    - create index.js, which will act as your entry point for your server.

The general file structure of your project is as follows:
    - public
        - contains index.html and other public assets
    - src   
        - contains your react components
    - server 
        - contains your server code
    
- NOTE: You must build your project before you can run it from your server. 
    - from your react directory: npm run build
    - this will create a build folder
